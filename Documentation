add
AngularFireModule.initializeApp(environment.firebase, 'my-app-name')
to imports

import all of these and add to imports inside app.module
import { AngularFireModule } from "@angular/fire";
import { AngularFirestoreModule } from "@angular/fire/firestore";
import { AngularFireAuthModule } from "@angular/fire/auth";

to avoid
@firebase/firestore: Firestore (5.8.0): The timestampsInSnapshots setting now defaults to true and you no longer need to explicitly set it. In a future release, the setting will be removed entirely and so it is recommended that you remove it from your firestore.settings() call now.
 in the console
 add { AngularFirestoreModule, FirestoreSettingsToken } in imports
 and in providors do { provide: FirestoreSettingsToken, useValue: {} }
 this is a hotfix until firestore is updated
